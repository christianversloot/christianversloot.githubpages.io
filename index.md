## Severe weather bites
Welcome to this website about severe weather. It includes small, bite-size thoughts about severe weather (primarily thunderstorms, but occasionally also other topics are covered). My name is Christian and I work in the weather industry. I don't work as a meteorologist, but as a data technologist - severe weather is just a passion. Needless to say, the contents of this website do not necessarily reflect the thoughts, opinions and points of view of my employer; they are just personal.
